# Notes
## P27
Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets.
   a) In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a predicate that generates all the possibilities via backtracking.

   Example:
   ?- group3([aldo,beat,carla,david,evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida],G1,G2,G3).
   G1 = [aldo,beat], G2 = [carla,david,evi], G3 = [flip,gary,hugo,ida]
   ...

   b) Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a list of group sizes and the predicate will return a list of groups.

   Example:
   ?- group([aldo,beat,carla,david,evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida],[2,2,5],Gs).
   Gs = [[aldo,beat],[carla,david],[evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida]]
   ...

   Note that we do not want permutations of the group members; i.e. [[aldo,beat],...] is the same solution as [[beat,aldo],...]. However, we make a difference between [[aldo,beat],[carla,david],...] and [[carla,david],[aldo,beat],...].

   You may find more about this combinatorial problem in a good book on discrete mathematics under the term "multinomial coefficients".
